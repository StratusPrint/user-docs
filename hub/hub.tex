      \item If this is the first time this system is being used, and the hub and octopi were not already set up for you, please consult
      the technical documents for set up.  Otherwise, proceed to the Nodes section.

      \item If you encounter difficulties with the hub or octopi, unplug them from the outlet, then
       plug them back in.  The system is designed to reset itself and re-connect
       after initial set-up is completed.
    \end{enumerate}
