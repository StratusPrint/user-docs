      \item If this is the first time this system is being used, please consult
      the technical documents for setting up the Hub.  Otherwise, proceed to the Nodes section.

      \item If you encounter difficulties with the Hub, unplug the Hub, then
       plug it back in.  The system is designed to reset itself and re-connect
       after initial set-up is completed.
