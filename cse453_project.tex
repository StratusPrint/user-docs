  \section{Overview}
  The stratus print system consists of four main parts. The web page, hub, nodes and printer
  control box. The web page is where the system is controlled. From the web page you can set up
  the system, monitor printers and control print jobs. The hub is the heart of the system. It is
  used to relay information from the printer control box and the nodes to the web page. The printer
  control box does what the name implies. Allows control of the printer through the web site as well
  as provides a button for canceling and completing print jobs.
