  The stratus print system consists of four main parts. The web page, hub, nodes and printer
  control box. The web page is where the system is controlled. From the web page you can set up
  the system, monitor printers and control print jobs. The hub is the heart of the system. It is
  used to relay information from the printer control box and the nodes to the web page. The printer
  control box does what the name implies. Allows control of the printer through the web site as well
  as provides a button for canceling and completing print jobs.

  \subsection{General Work flow}
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Upload a print job trough the web interface
      \item When the job is finished printing the red light on the printer control box
      will blink. This means it is safe to clean off the print service and prepare the
      surface for the next print job.
      \item When the surface is ready for the next print job press the flashing red button \textbf{ONCE} to start the next job in the queue.  \emph{Wait 20 seconds for the light to stop blinking after pressing the button.  It may take up to 20 seconds for the light to stop blinking while the next job in the queue is being processed!} 
    \end{enumerate}
